# smartMirror
This code is a SmartMirror. It reimagines a mirror as a tool for taking user inputs, and uses it to controll a smart assistant. (This is a prototype)

The concept is a “smart mirror” that takes the functionality from home assistants like google home
or amazon Alexa and combines it with machine learned hand tracking as the input. 
The program makes use of a machine-learning model called Handpose.

the program is also accesible at : https://editor.p5js.org/Magnustrojahn/sketches/RbnpF6XhZ
Run the code and use hand gestures to your webcam to controll the GUI.
